# Xamarin Binding Project for Material Components for iOS
Xamarin binding project for Material Components for iOS (MDC-iOS).

# Requirements
## MaterialComponents framework Dependencies
 The MaterialComponents for iOS Xanarin binding project requires the following Native Frameworks:
- MDFTextAccessibility, used by MaterialButtons components.

- MotionInterchange, â€‹MotionTransitioning and MotionAnimator used by MaterialMaskedTransition component.

The dependcies are resolved by Pod during the Xcode build phase.

# Xcode Build the required native frameworks (Optional)
The precompiled frameworks are provided
## Prerequisites

- Create an iOS SingleView Template Xcode project (Do not create Workspace)

- Create a "Podfile" file inside the Template project directory that contains the following:

``` ruby
target 'Template' do
  platform :ios, '8.0'
  use_frameworks!
  project 'Template.xcodeproj'
  pod 'MaterialComponents', '~> 31.0.0'
end
```
and then run
``` bash
$ pod install
```
## Build

- Open the "Pods" Xcode project
``` bash
$ cd Pods
$ open -a Xcode Pods.xcodeproj
```
- Build the "MaterialComponents" Target for "iphoneos" and for "iphonesimulator".

- Create **fat binaries** from the [built frameworks](#Framework dependencies) e.g.:
``` bash
    $ mkdir Frameworks
    $ for f in MaterialComponents MotionInterChange MotionAnimator MotionTransitioning
    do
        # Copy the required headers and other files.
        cp -pr build/Release/iponeos/${f}.framework Frameworks/
        lipo -create build/Release/ipone*/${f}.framework/${f} -output Frameworks/${f}.framework/${f}
        lipo -info Frameworks/${f}.framework/${f}
    done
```
- Copy the generated frameworks into Xamarin Binding's Frameworks direcotry.
